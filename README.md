# python-challenge
This repository will contain two projects, "PyPoll" an "PyBank",
that will demonstrate basic Python file and data manipulation.
The structure of this repository is determined by the specific
instructions provided.

Each project has a "README" file that serves as the design
document for the project.

In order to keep the format of this repository as requested,
the "extra" challenges are located in the "UCBX-Homework"
repository along with the other assignments.
